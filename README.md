# pros-project-template

PROS version: 4.2.1
LVGL version: 9.2.0

This template repository let's you easily create a new PROS project, one that's published to GitHub from the start.

### VSCode Extensions

When opening this project on VSCode, several extensions will be recommended if not installed:
- Better C++ Syntax
- C/C++ (slower than clangd, but more reliable)
- Error Lens
- Material Icon Theme
- PROS
- Symbolizer for VEX V5

> [!WARNING]
> **DO NOT** use clangd. It is incompatible with the C/C++ extension
